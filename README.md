<h1>Liberia Is Where My Story Begins</h1>
<p>I was born on July 7th, 1996 in Monrovia, Liberia. I am a son of Abdulaye and Madiafine Konneh. My older siblings names are Samuka and Fatoumata Konneh. My young siblings name is Mayama konneh. My favorite pastime is to play soccer or read some books. One of my favorite books of all time is “War And Peace” is a great book with good inspiration qoutes that is good for students, and a young person like me. Actually I don’t have favorite food because growing up with a single mother really helped me learned a lots of things, and some those things have helped to become the man I’m becomes. I never had time to picked what wanted to eat or what are ate, because my mother could barely prover for us.Growthing up wih my moher I learned the hard way </p>
